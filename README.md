**what i do**

python          • core language
deep learning   • neural architectures
ml/ai           • solving problems
linux systems   • where it runs
optimization    • making it faster

**currently**

building models that think
researching optimal architectures
exploring what's possible at scale

**motivation**

code is the closest thing to magic we have
